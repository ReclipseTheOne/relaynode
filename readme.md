# <u> Relay Node </u>

<p> Relay is a P2P-Node based CLI message platform that runs on the Relay Node Mesh Network.
<p> The area coverage and messaging speed should be completely dependent on the amount of unique Relay Nodes currently running and processing message requests.</p>
<p> At this point the relay nodes are not operational and a lot of work is still to be done. Any contributions are welcomed and will be gladly appreciated!</p>
